# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0-alpha] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- Pause with the `P` key: the simulation clock latches at zero, a `PAUSED`
  indicator appears over the frozen frame, and pressing `P` again resumes
  without applying the time spent paused
- `js/pause.js`, a pure module holding the pause toggle rules (latch on
  keydown, ignore key release and auto-repeat) and the frozen simulation
  delta, with unit tests
- `js/flight-state.js`, a pure module defining the starting condition
  gameplay begins from and `R` resets back to, with unit tests asserting
  flight starts at an airspeed of 0 knots
- `P - Pause` row in the on-screen controls help and the README controls
  table, and a page description for link previews of the demo page

### Changed

- The aircraft constructor and `reset()` now read their starting position,
  rotation, and speed from `js/flight-state.js` instead of repeating literal
  values, so the 0-knot start has a single source of truth

## [1.1.0-alpha] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- Q/E yaw input so the aircraft responds to every control listed in the
  on-screen help
- C-key camera cycling through CHASE, COCKPIT, and ORBIT modes, with the
  active mode reported on the HUD camera readout
- Zero-dependency unit test harness using `node:test` (`npm test` or
  `node --test`) covering HUD unit conversions, keyboard input-to-state
  mapping, and the mountain count formula
- `package.json` manifest and this changelog

### Changed

- Keyboard input mapping extracted into the pure module `js/input-map.js`,
  and HUD unit conversions and the mountain count formula exposed as pure
  functions, so all three are testable in Node without a browser
- README controls table updated with the yaw (`Q`/`E`) and camera cycling
  (`C`) keys

## [1.0.0-alpha] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- Baseline release: arcade flight model with pitch, roll, coordinated
  banking turns, throttle, and gravity
- Procedural terrain from multi-octave fractal Brownian motion noise with
  height-based vertex coloring (water, sand, grass, rock, snow)
- Random mountain placement covering roughly 10% of the terrain surface
  using smoothstep radial bumps
- Atmospheric fog and sky lighting
- Chase camera and HUD readout of airspeed, altitude, throttle, and camera
  mode
- Zero build step: runs directly in the browser via ES modules and an
  import map
